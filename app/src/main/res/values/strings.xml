    <string name="bio_text">I always wanted to be a veterinarian, and in 2016 my dream came true. I love animals and being around them makes me feel complete. In 2019 I started coding and I fell in love with the challenge that it gives me, so I decided to change careers and study in a Bootcamp. Currently I am working in Mobile Development and I love it. I hope in the future I can have a farm full of animals while working as a programmer remotely, this way I will be able to do both things I love!
